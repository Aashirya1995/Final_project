## Github Repository

Once we have our Github account set up. The next step is to have make a Github repository. To put your project up on Github, you will need to create a repository for it to live in. This is where we can keep a record of our work using the "commits". Whenever we add something new to our code we commit it before pushing it on Github. Every commit recieves a commit hash which makes keeping track of work much easier.
